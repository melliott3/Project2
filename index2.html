      <h2>Benefits of using Nuclear Energy</h2>
        <p>It produces no polluting gases.</p>
        <p>High technology research benefits other industries.</p>
        <p>Low fuel quantity reduces mining and transportation effects on the environment.</p>
        <p>Power stations have very long lifetimes.</p>

      <h2>Drawbacks of using Nuclear Energy</h2>
        <p>Waste is radioactive and safe disposal can be very difficult and expensive.</p>
        <p>Large scale accidents can be catastrophic.</p>
        <p>Costs of building and safely decommissioning are very high.</p>
        <p>Nuclear power has a very negative public opinion.</p>
        <p>Cannot react quickly to changes in electricity demand.</p>
      
      <h2>The Economic and Envioronmental Costs of Using Nuclear Energy</h2>
        <p>Nuclear power plants are expensive to build, but cheaper to run. The 104 nuclear units in the U.S. generate substantial domestic economic value in electricity sales and revenue - $40 to $50 billion each year - with over 100,000 workers contributing to production. </p>
        <p>A major environmental concern related to nuclear power is the creation of radioactive wastes such as uranium mill tailings, spent (used) reactor fuel, and other radioactive wastes. These materials can remain radioactive and dangerous to human health for thousands of years.</p>
        
      <h2>Does Nuclear Energy Output Any Type of Pollution?</h2>
        <p>Nuclear energy produces nuclear waste (or radioactive  waste). Nuclear power plants use uranium as fuel. The  process of mining uranium releases high amounts of  carbon dioxide into the environment. Carbon dioxide is  also released into the environment when new nuclear  power plants are built. Finally, the transport of radioactive  waste also causes carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

      <h2>What does Nuclear Power use to run?</h2>
        <p>Nuclear power uses uranium, and uranium is very abundant, with an average concentration of 2.8 parts per million in the Earthâ€™s crust. Traces of it occur almost everywhere. It is more abundant than gold, silver or mercury, about the same as tin, and slightly less abundant than cobalt and lead.</p>
        <p>Nuclear power is a non-renewable based process because it uses uranium and similar fuels that are finite, or will eventually run out.</p>
